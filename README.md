 Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered dataset which contains emergency vehicles like ambulance and fire trucks. This dataset contains images of emergency vehicles of normal and CCTV view. Then with the current dataset data engineering and feature engineering like removed noisy images and scaling of data has been done.


 Model Training:
   
Model Selection and Training: Various deep learning models suitable for object detection, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), You Only Look Once (YOLO), Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD), and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN). Selected the most appropriate model based on performance metrics, computational efficiency, and real-time processing capabilities. Trained the chosen model on the annotated dataset using transfer learning or from scratch, depending on the availability of labelled emergency vehicle data.

 Real-Time Object Detection: The model is trained using YOLO, R-CNN, MobileNet, SqueezeDet is now ready to perform real-time object detection of emergency vehicles in traffic. Now this model should be deployed on hardware devices for dynamic clearance of traffic.

Dynamic Clearance Algorithm: Developed a dynamic clearance algorithm using Traffic Flow Simulation, Optimization Algorithm, Queue Length estimation that analyses the detected emergency vehicle’s positions and surrounding traffic conditions to determine the optimal clearance path. Use machine learning techniques to predict traffic flow patterns and anticipate potential congestion points along the clearance route. Design the algorithm to prioritize the clearance of emergency vehicles while minimizing disruptions to other traffic participants.



 POST TRAINING PROCESSES

System Integration and Evaluation: Integrate the real-time object detection module and dynamic clearance algorithm into a cohesive emergency vehicle management system. Conduct extensive evaluations using simulation environments and real-world test scenarios to assess the system's performance in terms of clearance efficiency, response time reduction, and traffic impact. Compare the proposed system with existing methods and benchmarks to validate its effectiveness and practicality in mitigating traffic congestion for emergency vehicles.
Deployment and Validation: Deploy the developed system in collaboration with local emergency service providers or transportation authorities to validate its usability and effectiveness in real-world settings. Gather feedback from stakeholders, including emergency responders, traffic engineers, and the general public, to identify areas for improvement and potential scalability of the system.


CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT
In this work we have proposed a system that can succesfully detect and send interrupts to the system to turn the traffic signals red, green or yellow based on the requirement. Such a system will be extremely helpful in urban areas with high traffic density and can be used to clear traffic quickly, mitigating the risk of death or potential loss of life due to late medical care. Many lives can be saved with this system and it 
is aimed at being cheap and easy to install, by using only existing CCTV as the captial or hardware needed and simply functioning as a plug and play software. Our Model has achieved success in being a modular, light and easy to integrate system.
Future scope of this system includes multiple other integrated sensors such as the forementioned sound sensing method, or utilizing a smart network system which utilizes different frequencies to communicate beforehand with the upcoming traffic signals, and a priority MAC assigning system to always ensure that the system is not overcrowded and has a slot to establish connection and communicate to clear traffic. 
A similar system to networks is the RFID system which works exaclty like the current “FASTAG” system used in Indian Toll Plazas [14]. Such RFIDs are also a relatively cheap to implement solution, however the RF Reader would require regular maintenance. Other Future scope also involves using GPS or SATNAV systems to use in tandem with the existing system, based on the GPS tracking system as proposed in .
